# Resume
This is my resume written in [ latex ](https://www.latex-project.org/).
And this is based on [this](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/rendercv-engineeringresumes-theme/shwqvsxdgkjy)

## How to compile
If you want to use this as a template for your resume,
you can compile it using the following command using `pdflatex`:
```bash
pdflatex main.tex
```

It should generate a `main.pdf` file which you can view.
